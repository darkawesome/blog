This is a project I did for my linux class final project. In this project I set up a LAMP stack server and I hosted it using the google cloud platofrm. This site is now down as the hosting went to a paid tier after a trial period and I didn't want to pay for something I could do for free 

Below is a video describing the site and lorem ipsum.
