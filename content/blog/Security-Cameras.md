The Swann Dvr8 4580v is an interesting camera system.
<!--more-->

Personally, I think this system is a great, cost efficient, security camera system. However, there are some things to consider before buying. The motion detection, night vision mode and the perimeter intrusion detection systems are pretty good. As my first system the setup went smooth and the app on mobile and pc work great. 

## Pros

  1.  Cost Efficiency: The Swann DVR8-4580V provides good value for its price, offering a comprehensive security solution without breaking the bank.
  2.  Motion Detection: The system's motion detection capabilities are effective, helping to capture relevant activity and reduce unnecessary recordings.
  3.  Night Vision Mode: The night vision mode performs well, ensuring clear footage even in low-light conditions.
  4.  Perimeter Intrusion Detection: This feature adds an extra layer of security by alerting you to potential intrusions within your property.
  5.  Ease of Setup: For a first-time user, the setup process is smooth and straightforward.
  6.  Mobile and PC App: The accompanying apps for mobile and PC work seamlessly, providing convenient access to your camera feeds and system settings.

## Cons

  1.  Video Quality: One notable downside is that the video quality might not meet the high-definition standards some users expect. While adequate for general surveillance, it might lack the clarity required for detailed analysis.
  2. Wired Networking: Not a huge problem but when it comes to scissors being the biggest negative to your home security it is concerning. The option for Wifi connectivity would be a lot better here with it being marketed to the Home DIYer. 
  3. Mobile and PC App: From what is available on the market the HomeSafe View app, (about 4 years old at the time of this post) underperforms in its use. When remotely accessing the cameras their is a long wait time for the live view as well as an even longer wait for playback ( when remote). When on the LAN the speeds are faster though with how quickly you can access a ring cameras video it is still behind the market. Though the options for what you can do remotely are abundant.

  
## Conclusion

The Swann DVR8-4580V is a solid entry-level security camera system with a range of useful features. Its cost efficiency, effective motion detection, and reliable night vision make it a worthy consideration for those looking to enhance their home security. However, potential buyers should weigh the trade-off with video quality, depending on their specific needs and expectations. Overall, itâ€™s a reliable choice for those seeking an affordable and easy-to-use security solution. The newer models seem to offer a better experience. Though with competition like Blink, Ring and google all offering similar home security solutions... It seems like Swann have a specific DIYer base that they are marketing to.
