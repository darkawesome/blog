I bought a fire pit off of 42 fab (https://www.42fab.com/weld-it-yourself/firebowl?category=Firepits) and it was a lot of fun to put together and use. Welding everything up and getting it all fitted was a bit of a struggle but I learned a lot. Besides just getting your setting up and right you also have to actually be sitting pretty comfortable to lay down nice beads.

More importantly, you have to make sure the welds are penetrating. I used my little YesWelder to do this and it did alright. I wanted to use stick welding but I just couldn’t figure it all out. Scraped it a ton and got it to arch but I was running a 6013 instead of a 6010 and the rod was being eaten up. Learned after that this was due to that rod being used for caps rather than roots which wasn’t a huge difference for this. It just meant I would end up going through a lot more sticks.

I did end up getting a 6011 (similar to 6010) but I had messed something up with the stinger and had caused it to arc at the actual stinger. So I chose to switch to flux core. Which turned out a lot better. I had a friend of mine giving me pointers and help along the way and I was able to lay down some pretty solid welds. Though at the beginning, they were pretty shaky and bad. As I got comfortable and more into a rhythm I was able to get this done pretty quick.

After a little bit of messing around, I was able to put this together in a few hours and get a solid fire going. Though after 30 minutes or so the ash pile was right around the top of the bowl. So for version two, I'm going to make the same thing just scaled up.

One interesting thing that happened as the wind flew over the top was the gaps pushed more air into the pit. Besides, when burning some leaves or somewhat wet wood the fire was smokeless. And getting some temperature readings the bottom of the pit stayed around 150 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the 600+ degree fire itself. This could be from the splits in the feet at the bottom or maybe the steel not transferring the heat as much. I'm not sure.

All in all, it was a lot of fun! And for $50 it was an easy afternoon of fun.
