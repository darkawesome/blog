I'm a recent Penn State graduate pursuing a master's degree in public policy. I am eager to apply my technical acumen and analytical skills to support government initiatives and policies, ultimately driving data-driven insights that enhance public services and governance. I am adept at problem-solving, and adapting to new challenges, I am well-prepared to bridge the gap between IT expertise and government affairs for a more informed and efficient public sector. 

Throughout my career, I have worked with various technologies and tools, including R, Stata, Docker, ArcGisPro, and Git. I am comfortable working in both Linux and Windows environments and have experience with database management.

If you're looking for a results-driven professional with a strong background in IT I am looking for a career that combines government relations and data analytics.
