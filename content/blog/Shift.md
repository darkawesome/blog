## The Plan

I plan to pursue a career in data science. I think this is where the tech industry is moving and where jobs will be in more demand. While information technology is something that I have a passion for it is not something that has a lot of creativity. While pursuing IT I wanted to become a System Admin as working at an IT helpdesk it was the next logical step. After working around the people that were at the level that I wanted to achieve I realized that it was not what I wanted for myself and that industry would be moving away from it. At the time we were already seeing the team size being cut from ten down to seven. While this was due to covid I was able to see a trend as the same amount of work was done with less. And in some cases the work was able to be done remotely.

## Next Steps

For the next few months I will be working to create projects centered around data science and looking at how to optimize simple things in my life. So of course I am going to start with looking at my spending and will see how much I can do to implement savings and other things along with that.
