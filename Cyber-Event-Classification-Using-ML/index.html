Some of the topics covered were TF-IDF, Dimensionality reductions, encoding, ensemble learning, and some model evaluation techniques.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/darkawesome/blog/blob/main/blog/content/img/CyberClassifi/Random-Forest-Algorithm.webp?raw=true" alt=Summary></p><p>This took many weeks of reading documentation and learning more about AI. I started trying to use deep learning but rethought my approach to be more based on what I already knew from statistics. This transition was a lot easier as my pretraining was essentially the same.
The primary goal of this project was to build a machine learning model capable of predicting key attributes of cybersecurity incidents based on textual descriptions. The attributes predicted include:</p><ul><li>Event Type</li><li>Actor Type</li><li>Industry</li><li>Motive</li><li>Event Subtype</li></ul><p>The pipeline integrates natural language processing (NLP), feature engineering, and machine learning classification to analyze and categorize cybersecurity event data.</p><h2 id=handling-text-data>Handling Text Data

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The description field (a textual representation of each event) was vectorized using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Initially, 4,000 features were extracted, later expanded to 6,000 for improved performance. Unigrams and bigrams were used in vectorization to capture both individual words and two-word phrases.
Given the high-dimensional nature of TF-IDF features, Truncated SVD (a variation of PCA for sparse data) was applied. What happens in this step is that the top 4,000 most important words (features) will be kept, [changed to 6000 for testing] based on their frequency and uniqueness across the dataset, and will ignore those that are frequently included like &ldquo;the&rdquo;.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/darkawesome/blog/blob/main/blog/content/img/CyberClassifi/IDF-Formula.webp?raw=true" alt=Summary></p><p><img src="https://github.com/darkawesome/blog/blob/main/blog/content/img/CyberClassifi/The-TF-Formula.webp?raw=true" alt=Summary></p><p>Key findings:</p><ul><li>2,500 components preserved 91.95% variance.</li><li>3,000 components preserved 95.07% variance but took over 15 minutes to run.</li></ul><p>I went with 2,500 components as a tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency. This was being run on a laptop and waiting the 15 minutes was not something I wanted to do after every change. Initially, multiple train-test splits were performed separately for each target variable, which could introduce data leakage.
A single consistent train-test split was implemented using numpy indexing to ensure that all models were trained and tested on the same subsets of data.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#e6edf3;background-color:#0d1117;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-py data-lang=py><span style=display:flex><span>tfidf <span style=color:#ff7b72;font-weight:700>=</span> TfidfVectorizer(max_features<span style=color:#ff7b72;font-weight:700>=</span><span style=color:#a5d6ff>6000</span>, ngram_range<span style=color:#ff7b72;font-weight:700>=</span>(<span style=color:#a5d6ff>1</span>, <span style=color:#a5d6ff>2</span>))

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>This project involved text-based classification with dimensionality reduction, data transformation, and machine learning modeling. Despite challenges with data leakage, feature encoding, and model performance, the system effectively categorizes cybersecurity incidents and serves as a foundation for further improvements. However, given that the user could simply hit enter to autocomplete and just enter the other fields, I don&rsquo;t think this tool is a best practice. It has a real potential to be misused and produce bad data quality.</p><p>A lot of the work done was informed by prior statistics classes, getting guidance from professors, and reading Geeks for Geeks writeups on functions. I have never done a real project like this and it was fun to get a working project at the end of it. I would&rsquo;ve liked to create a user interface with a nice text box that shows the current row to be submitted to the file, but I am a graduate student and there are papers to write. After learning a bit more about the libraries that Python has for machine learning, I have a real appreciation for all of the LLM companies and GitHub projects out there. It speaks a lot to their patience and the real pressure to produce something that works better than the last iteration. This was a pretty simple project in comparison, but shed a lot of light on a single process. I didn&rsquo;t share all of my code here as I think more people are interested in the thought process and whether or not the code works. And since it does, I am just showing my results and what I learned. I could be wrong, and if so I will release the code I used later to show the entire process.</p><p>So far, for writing to the csv file, it predicts the targeted fields and then opens the csv. From there it gathers user input for the other rows and then writes it to the csv. I am working on an API for this dataset, which would complicate this process more, but I don&rsquo;t think it would be too bad if it&rsquo;s just one insert at a time. It would be slower but than a BULK INSERT query but the actual work behind coding the work could be easier. All of that is yet to be seen as I am in the middle of three papers for school and for some reason they won&rsquo;t write themselves.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/darkawesome/blog/blob/blog/content/img/CyberClassifi/Screenshot-2024-03-07-212513.png?raw=true" alt=Summary></p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>Â©
