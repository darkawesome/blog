<p>Right off the bat after install I went into the etc/samba/smb.conf file and went to look at the
default configs. I didn’t really understand some of what was in there and didn’t have any use for the
printer section. So I just made my own config file from scratch and used the samba wiki for support when
needed. I also asked Steve about setting a workgorup in the config but did not. As per his advice, it was
not needed if it were to be a standalone server. The next road block was getting my windows pc to see my
laptops samba share. When I went the option of typing in the ip address in file explorer I got an error. I
then thought of starting over and using 2 virtual machines and using NAT so they would be able to talk to
each other but before that I asked Steve another question about the hosts file. I thought the two machines
might need to know about each other prior to allowing connection and he said it would depend on the
config. And that there may be a setting somewhere about only allowing the hosts in host.allow. I thought
that by making the user that connects, a user with limited privileges, I could circumvent that. However,
that didn’t end up working and I continued to try the host.file way. At this point I added the windows PC
into the host.allow file and tried to ssh into it but just received a “no such host is known” error. So in a bit
of a cheating way but maybe better for my circumstances I just put logmeinhamachi on both machines
and connected them using that vpn service. So even when my laptop and PC are in different networks I
am still able to upload files to the server and as long as both are online I can retrieve those files. For some
reason doing a systemctl status smbd.service returns a message highlighted in red however its not an error
and just says</p>

<p>In this project I connected my computers to each other using logmeinhamachi and ran a samba file server on 1 machine to serve files.</p>
