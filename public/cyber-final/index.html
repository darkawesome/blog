    <p>The following is from my final project on nation state cyber threat actors. I did a surface level look at who and how they attack their targets based on the best available data.</p>
<h2 id="summary">

<p>Nation-state cyber attacks have become a significant threat in modern international relations, with over 30 countries utilizing this attack type and approximately 790 total attacks documented. These operations typically span months to years, with attackers gathering massive amounts of information before executing their primary objectives.</p>

<p>I began with the idea that the majority of the attacks would be coming from Russia and China with the United States being the most targeted by these types of attacks. In the media these attacks are played up a lot to be a threat to the American people however events like the Solarwinds attacks still continue on to today.</p>
<p>My other big assumption was that these types of attacks fall short to the number of attacks used by citizens within the country. Typically with these attack types laying ground work and entering systems takes a lot longer for nation-states then dedicated teams of cyber criminals. Cyber criminals who may be more opportunistic or leveraging known CVE&rsquo;s, or simply being script kiddies.</p>

<p>Primary Focus: Political espionage, particularly around elections
Strategic Approach: Views cyber disruptions as a foreign policy tool to influence other countries&rsquo; decisions
Military Integration: Has formally adopted cyber attacks into their warfare doctrine
Capabilities: Continuously refines espionage, influence, and attack capabilities</p>

<p>Network Structure: Operates through an extensive APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) network
Escalation Timeline: Significant increase in attacks observed from the end of Obama&rsquo;s administration
Motivations: Uses cyber attacks as responses to political disputes, including border conflicts and trade tensions</p>

<p>Strategic Goals:</p>
<p>Bypass international sanctions
Gather intelligence
Generate revenue through cryptocurrency theft</p>
<p>Targeting: Focuses on critical infrastructure, government systems, and high-value private entities
Cost-Effectiveness: Cyber operations provide a cost-effective way to project power internationally
Adaptability: Has begun diversifying attack methods and exploiting known vulnerabilities</p>
<p>Nation-State vs. All Attack Types
The data suggests that nation-state actors represent a disproportionate threat compared to other cyber attack categories, with their operations being more sophisticated, persistent, and strategically coordinated than typical cybercriminal activities.</p>

<p>For my project I had to provide policy recommendations. However, I am skeptical that increasing eduction, literacy programs or increasing reporting will effectively change the current trajectory of the issue. I would rather suggest a more diplomatic approach like what was had during the Obama presidency with China. Geopolitical tensions and supoprting the Ukraine war showed increases in cyber attacks making the environment around the issue more complex. A diplomatic solution here could create norms around its use and perhaps reduce the use altogether if that is still possible. Given how it is sometimes hard to verify who the individuals are behind a hack or even if you have been hacked.</p>
